<h1>Strategies</h1>

<p>
High-performance solvers, such as Z3, contain many tightly integrated, handcrafted heuristic 
combinations of algorithmic proof methods. While these heuristic
combinations tend to be highly tuned for known classes of problems, 
they may easily perform very badly on new classes of problems.
This issue is becoming increasingly pressing
as solvers begin to gain the attention of practitioners in diverse areas of science and engineering. 
In many cases, changes to the solver heuristics can make a
tremendous difference.
</p>

<p>
In this tutorial we show how to create custom strategies using the basic building blocks
available in Z3. Z3 implement the ideas proposed in this 
<a target="_blank" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leonardo/strategy.pdf">article</a>.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Z3 implements  a methodology for orchestrating reasoning
engines where "big" symbolic reasoning steps are represented as
functions known as <b>tactics</b>, and tactics are composed using
combinators known as <b>tacticals</b>. Tactics process sets of 
formulas called <b>Goals</b>.
</p>

<p>
When a tactic is applied to some goal <tt>G</tt>, four different outcomes 
are possible. In SMT 2.0, the goal is the conjunction of all assertions.
The tactic succeeds in showing <tt>G</tt> to be satisfiable (i.e., feasible);
succeeds in showing <tt>G</tt> to be unsatisfiable (i.e., infeasible); produces a sequence of subgoals; or fails.
When reducing a goal <tt>G</tt> to a sequence of subgoals <tt>G1</tt>, ...,
<tt>Gn</tt>, we face the problem of model conversion.
A <b>model converter</b> construct a model for <tt>G</tt>
using a model for some subgoal <tt>Gi</tt>. 
</p>

<p>In the following example, we use the command <tt>apply</tt> to execute a tactic 
composed of two built-in tactics: <tt>simplify</tt> and <tt>solve-eqs</tt>. The tactic <tt>simplify</tt>
apply transformations equivalent to the ones found in the command <tt>simplify</tt>. The tactic <tt>solver-eqs</tt>
eliminate variables using Gaussian elimination. Actually, <tt>solve-eqs</tt> is not restricted only to linear arithmetic.
It can also eliminate arbitrary variables. Then, combinator <tt>then</tt> applies <tt>simplify</tt> to the input goal
and <tt>solve-eqs</tt> to each subgoal produced by <tt>simplify</tt>. In this example, only one subgoal is produced.
</p>

<pre pref="tactic.1" />

<p>In the example above, variable <tt>x</tt> is eliminated, and is not present the resultant goal.
</p>

<p>In Z3, we say a <b>clause</b> is any constraint of the form <tt>(or f_1 ... f_n)</tt>.
The tactic <tt>split-clause</tt> will select a clause <tt>(or f_1 ... f_n)</tt> in the input goal, and split it 
<tt>n</tt> subgoals. One for each subformula <tt>f_i</tt>.
</p>

<pre pref="tactic.2" />

<h2>Tactics</h2>

<p>Z3 comes equipped with many built-in tactics.
The command <tt>(help-tactic)</tt> provides a short description of all built-in tactics.
</p>

<pre pref="tactic.3" />

<p>Z3 comes equipped with the following tactic combinators (aka tacticals):
</p>

<ul>
<li> <tt>(then t s)</tt>
applies <tt>t</tt> to the input goal and <tt>s</tt>
  to every subgoal produced by <tt>t</tt>.
</li>
<li> <tt>(par-then t s)</tt>
applies <tt>t</tt> to the input goal and <tt>s</tt>
  to every subgoal produced by <tt>t</tt> in parallel.
</li>
<li> <tt>(or-else t s)</tt>
first applies <tt>t</tt> to the given goal,
if it fails then returns the result of <tt>s</tt> applied to the given goal.
</li>
<li> <tt>(par-or t s)</tt> applies <tt>t</tt> and <tt>s</tt> in parallel until one of them
succeed. The tractic fails if <tt>t</tt> and <tt>s</tt> fails.
</li>
<li> <tt>(repeat t)</tt> Keep applying the given tactic until no subgoal is modified by it.
</li>
<li> <tt>(repeat t n)</tt> Keep applying the given tactic until no subgoal is modified by it, or
the number of iterations is greater than <tt>n</tt>.
</li>
<li> <tt>(try-for t ms)</tt> Apply tactic <tt>t</tt> to the input goal, if it does not return in
<tt>ms</tt> millisenconds, it fails.
</li>
<li> <tt>(using-params t params)</tt> Apply the given tactic using the given parameters.
<tt>(! t params)</tt> is a shorthand for <tt>(using-params t params)</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<p> The combinators <tt>then</tt>, <tt>par-then</tt>, <tt>or-else</tt> and <tt>par-or</tt>
accept arbitrary number of arguments.
The following example demonstrate how to use these combinators.</p>

<pre pref="tactic.4" />

<p>In the last <tt>apply</tt> command, the tactic <tt>solve-eqs</tt> discharges all but one goal.
Note that, this tactic generates one goal: the empty goal which is trivially satisfiable (i.e., feasible) </p>

<p>A tactic can be used to decide whether a set of assertions has a solution (i.e., is satisfiable) or not.
The command <tt>check-sat-using</tt> is similar to <tt>check-sat</tt>, but uses the given tactic instead of
the Z3 default solver for solving the current set of assertions.
If the tactic produces the empty goal, then <tt>check-sat-using</tt> returns <tt>sat</tt>.
If the tactic produces a single goal containing <tt>False</tt>, then <tt>check-sat-using</tt> returns <tt>unsat</tt>.
Otherwise, it returns <tt>unknown</tt>.
</p>

<pre pref="tactic.6" />

<p>In the example above, the tactic used implements a basic bit-vector solver using equation solving,
bit-blasting, and a propositional SAT solver. 
</p>

<p>In the following example, we use the combinator <tt>using-params</tt> to configure our little solver. 
We also include the tactic <tt>aig</tt>
which tries to compress Boolean formulas using And-Inverted Graphs.
</p>

<pre pref="tactic.7" />

<p>The tactic <tt>smt</tt> wraps the main solver in Z3 as a tactic.</p>

<pre pref="tactic.8" />

<p>Now, we show how to implement a solver for integer arithmetic using SAT. The solver is complete
only for problems where every variable has a lower and upper bound.
</p>

<pre pref="tactic.9" />

<p>The next example demonstrates how to run different strategies in parallel using the combinator <tt>par-or</tt>.
It also shows how to run different instances of the <tt>smt</tt> tactic using different random seeds.</p>

<pre pref="tactic.10" />


<h2>Probes</h2>

<p>
<b>Probes</b> (aka formula measures) are evaluated over goals.
Boolean expressions over them can be built using relational operators and Boolean connectives.
The tactic <tt>(fail-if cond)</tt> fails if the given goal does not satisfy the condition <tt>cond</tt>.
Many numeric and Boolean measures are available in Z3. The command <tt>(help-tactic)</tt> provides the list of 
all built-in probes.
</p>

<pre pref="probe.1" />

<p>In the following example, we build a simple tactic using <tt>fail-if</tt>. 
It also shows that <tt>echo</tt> can be used to display the value returned by a probe.
The <tt>echo</tt> tactic is mainly used for debugging purposes.
</p>

<pre pref="probe.2" />

<p>Z3 also provides the combinator (tactical) <tt>(if p t1 t2)</tt> which is a shorthand for:</p>

<pre>(or-else (then (fail-if (not p)) t1) t2)</pre>

<p>The combinator <tt>(when p t)</tt> is a shorthand for:</p>

<pre>(if p t skip)</pre>

<p>The tactic <tt>skip</tt> just returns the input goal.
The following example demonstrates how to use the <tt>if</tt> combinator.</p>
